            </td>
            <p>Lord Ganesha is one of the most worshiped gods in the country. He is the son of Lord Shiva and Devi Parvati. Legend has that Shiva cut off Ganesha’s throat because of anger. However, he soon regained his cool and replaced it with the head of an elephant. 

                To compensate for this behavior he also gave Ganesha a boon that he would be worshiped before all gods. It is this reason that Lord Ganesha is always worshiped before any other lord.
                
                Any auspicious occasion or religious ceremony commences only after Lord Ganesha has been worshiped. His temples are located all across the country and even in some of the remotest corners of the country. Here are the most popular of them-</p>

                    <p>Ganapati, who was proclaimed as the chief of the ganas by Lord Shiva and was revered as the principle deity to be worshipped among all the deities. It is said that the darsan of Vinayak being called by the names of Ganesh, Vigneshwar, Ganapathi, etc. is must before visiting even the principle deity in temples. Likewise it was said in all the Epics and Puranas that the hurdles of those who worship the idol of Vigneswar prepared with auspicious turmeric in every Worship, Vrat and Function celebrated in the house would be removed and only then the worship or vrat would be completed without any obstructions. There are so many temples in the country with various names to Vinayak.

                        The size of Dodda Ganapati is increasing every year like the Swayambhu Vinayakas at Bikavolu in East Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh and at Kanipakam in Chittoor district. Growing to the right, Dodda Ganapati is the Monolithic Ganapati reached to the present size. Nadaprabhu Hiriya Kempe Gouda, also known as Kempe Gouda of the Vijayanagara dynasty, while he was wondering, found several stones and on one of the rocks he found the Ganapati image and ordered the sculptors to turn the stone into a huge and magnificent monolithic statue. The largest idol of Lord Ganesh in Karnataka can be seen in this Dodda Ganapati temple. Dodda means big in Kannada. Dodda Ganapati express the meaning of Big Ganapati. Inside the temple, Ganapati appears with eighteen feet high and sixteen feet wide.
